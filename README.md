# 'Dangerous' Tutorials

Notes and additional exercises for Michael Hartl's 'Learn Enough To Be Dangerous' series of tutorials.

## The Setup

We'll be using the *Learn Enough* tutorial series. The first one is here:

https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial

Since Windows does not have a Linux-like command line, you'll have to run a 'virtual machine' within Windows on your computer. 

The big picture is:

  1. download and install VirtualBox (it's free)
  2. download a virtual machine 'image' (provided by the tutorial, also free)
  3. install the image in VirtualBox

Then, voila!, you'll have a Linux 'virtual machine' running inside of your Windows machine--like a computer within a computer.

Here are the details for the above steps:

  1. Download and install VirtualBox (it's free)
  Go to: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and click on 'Windows hosts' near the top of the page.  This should start downloading as soon as you click it. (Mine took about 1 minute.)  Download should show up at the bottom of your browser--click on it to start its installation wizard.
  It may ask a few questions:

    - something about disconnecting you from the network--that's fine
    - may be a popup asking 'are you sure you want to install'--click 'yes'
  
  Install should only take a few seconds.

  2. Download a virtual machine 'image' (provided by the tutorial, also free)
  The link for this is in the first part of the tutorial.  Go to 'Box 2' in the tutorial and click the link there where it says: '2. Download the Learn Enough Virtual Machine (large file)' It's a 2.5 GB file so it will take a while to download (mine took about 30 minutes)--so go get a snack while you wait.

  3. Install the image in VirtualBox
  Once you've got the vm downloaded, double-click on it (it should be an 'ova' file.  It will ask about changing settings--don't change anything for now.  Just click 'import'--it should take about 1 minute.

Ok, you're almost thereâ€¦
